## Introduction

An academic CV is an essential document for researchers and students pursuing higher education. It highlights your academic achievements, research experience, publications, skills, and other relevant information. This repository aims to provide a range of visually appealing and well-structured LaTeX templates to help you create a professional academic CV effortlessly.

## Templates

The repository currently includes the following academic CV templates:

- [Template 1](template1/): A modern and clean design with emphasis on research experience and publications.
- [Template 2](template2/): A traditional design with a focus on education and research interests.
- [Template 3](template3/): A minimalist design suitable for researchers in various disciplines.
- [Template 4](template4/): A visually striking design that highlights key accomplishments.

Feel free to explore each template's folder for a preview of the LaTeX source code (\*.tex) and the corresponding PDF output (\*.pdf).

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
├── template1/
│   ├── template1.tex
│   └── template1.pdf
├── template2/
│   ├── template2.tex

Each template folder contains a LaTeX source file (`*.tex`) and a corresponding PDF output (`*.pdf`).

## Usage

1. Choose the template that best suits your preferences and academic background.
2. Download the template's folder (`templateX/`) from the repository.
3. Customize the LaTeX source file (`templateX.tex`) with your own information.
4. Compile the LaTeX document using a LaTeX compiler (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX) to generate the PDF output (`templateX.pdf`).
5. Review the PDF output and make any necessary adjustments to the LaTeX source file.
